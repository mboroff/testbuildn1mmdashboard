These files will update the raspberry pi code, add node-red, add sqlite3, build the qsos database, 
open the editor to settings.js to modify the project option to true. When the edit is completed the Pi will reboot.

Prepare a new raspberry pi image.

SSH into the Pi and enter this command

git clone https://github.com/mboroff/testbuildn1mmdashboard && sudo chmod +x testbuildn1mmdashboard/buildn1mmdashboard.sh  && ./testbuildn1mmdashboard/buildn1mmdashboard.sh

Then follow the ptompts.

When the Pi rebots access node-red and clone the project.
